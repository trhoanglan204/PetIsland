- **`PetIsland.DataAccess`**: Manages data access, including the Repository pattern, DbContext, and Migrations.
- **`PetIsland.Utility`**: Contains utilities like email sending, session handling, and system constants.
- **`PetIslandWeb`**: The main MVC web application, including controllers, views, SignalR, and payment configurations.

## I. Installation and Running the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

## Drawbacks & Potential Vulnerabilities
- Old Version of CKEditor: The project uses CKEditor version 4.22.1, which might have some security vulnerabilities due to its age. You should consider upgrading it to the latest version for better security.
    - [CKEditor](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/4.22.1/standard/ckeditor.js)
